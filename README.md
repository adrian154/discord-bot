# discord-bot
My Discord bot. Mostly random features that I use on my server(s).

## Can I add this bot to my server?

No. If you want to use this bot's features you will have to deploy it yourself.

# Configuring the bot

See CONFIG.md

# Running the bot

Run `npm start`.

# Remarks on HTTP/HTTPS

This bot does serve files over the web (favicons for `$mcping`). The bot only supports HTTP directly, so if you want to securely serve these images you must use a reverse proxy.
